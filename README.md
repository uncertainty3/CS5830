# CS5830
This repo consists of all the assignments and projects done in the CS5830 Big Data Lab course.

# Assignment 2
This consists of 2 tasks:
# Task 1:
Fetching files from a given URL and zipping it to a local work directory.

# Task 2:
Unzipping the files from task 1. Then, calculate monthly averages of data present in CSV files. Use Geopandas to visualize the data.

Both tasks were implemented using DAG's in Airflow. Task 2 uses an Apache-Beam pipeline.
